//===================================================
//	Coding style
//===================================================

Header files are included from other files.
They are usually prefixed with h_*
and have extensions: .hlsl, .fxh


Source files are translation units, they contain
GPU resources and programs (shaders).
Prefixes: p_* (programs), r_* (resources),
Extensions: .fx .


//===================================================
//	To do
//===================================================


1) support for shader libraries in DLLs:

struct DLL_IMPORT Shader { //...



2) static members can be anywhere in memory (bad for cache),
use stack for lightweight shaders:

struct Shader1
{
public:
	static cbData1 data;
};

struct Shader2
{
public:
	cbData2 data;
};

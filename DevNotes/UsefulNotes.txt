Code-search sites include:

Google Code Search -  www.google.com/codesearch - A search for "include" finds 809,000 C++ files and 4 million C files. Google is mistakenly classifying at least some C++ code as C code. For example, some Boost code is classified as C code. No apparent way to exclude comments from search.

codesearch.net - csourcesearch.net - 283 million lines of C/C++ code in 1.1 million files. Searches do not yield total hit counts, making the site less useful than it might otherwise be.

koders - www.koders.com - Claims 424 million lines of code, but doesn't appear to have as much C/C++ code as others. No apparent way to exclude comments from search.

krugle - www.krugle.com - Appears to have 1,388,870 files classified as C++ code. Allows comments to be excluded from search.



* Visual Studio, debug output panel, go to file/line on mouse click

	Visual Studio understands it if you write in format:

	"%s(%d,%d): %s", fileNameStr, lineNum, columnNum, messageStr

	e.g.

	R:/test.fx(8,1): Syntax error: EOF expected

	you can double-click on it and go that location
